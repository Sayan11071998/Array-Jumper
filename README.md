# ðŸš€ 1D Array Jumper ðŸŽ®

## Project Milestone

Super excited to share my latest C++ project: **1D Array Jumper**! Built using SFML for visual rendering, this simple yet challenging game takes the player on an adventure across a 1D array-like platform. The goal? Move, jump, and avoid obstacles to reach the end! This project has been an incredible learning journey, helping me solidify my understanding of data structures and game development.

## Game Highlights

- **Player Movement**  
  Move or jump based on the values in the platform array.

- **Puzzle Decisions**  
  Strategize whether to move forward, backward, or jump to avoid tricky obstacles.

- **Health System**  
  Start with 3 lives. Hit an obstacle? You lose a life. Lose all lives, and itâ€™s back to the start.

- **Level Progression**  
  Each cleared level introduces tougher decisions and more complex challenges.

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Structures**  
  Strengthened my grasp on 1D arrays, array operations, and explored how STL vectors outperform raw arrays.

- **Design Patterns**  
  Used the MVC pattern to keep code clean, organized, and modular.

- **SFML Magic**  
  Learned to integrate SFML into C++ for smooth rendering, UI visuals, and sound effects.

- **C++ OOP**  
  Applied object-oriented principles to make the code more flexible and scalable.
